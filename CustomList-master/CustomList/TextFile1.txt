(5 points): As a developer, I want to write documentation in a .txt file that describes the details and functionality of my – operator overload. 
I want to include details such as “syntax”, “parameters”, “return type”, and an example of it being used, with the output. 


Goal is to overload the "–" operator to subtract one instance of a custom list class from another instance of a custom list class.

Syntax

listOne - listTwo;

Parameters

It accepts CustomList<T> listOne and CustomList<T> listTwo where listTwo values are being "-" from listOne.

Return Type

The return type is of Type<T>.

Example:
 -List<int> one = new List<int>() {1,3,5}; 
 -List<int> two = new List<int>() {2,1,6};
 -List<int> result = one - two;
 -result = {3,5};
